# polynomial_identities
Randomized algorithm for verifying if two polynomials given in diferent representations are equal

text_cases.txt contains 1000 pairs of randomly generated polynomials in canonical and product representation respectively
text_cases.txt contains only 3 pairs of polynomials in which each pair is the same polynomial in different representation
